Linux QoS scripts which I used on my home Internet connection.

The authoritative source is:
http://git.coverfire.com
but the repository can also be found at:
https://github.com/dansiemon/linux-qos-scripts

src-3tos.sh is the recommended script. It creates per host fairness
with 3 priority classes for each host. See the comment at the top of the
script for an explanation and links to experimental results.

You'll probably want to change some of the configuration items at the
top of the script.
